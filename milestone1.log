ebf752f,Alexander McGilvray,4 days ago,sped up boxy boxersons attack to a sane speed now that we have a fixed timestep update loop
92fa9a3,Alexander McGilvray,4 days ago,Fixed a bug where the joystick press and release virtual key states were not setting correctly due to the array that contains the state of the buttons from the previous frame was never set.
e08c724,Alexander McGilvray,6 days ago,setup character movement states to use character data. Also gave the data a value that works better with the fixed timestep that was implemented a while back. Characters dont move slow as hell now.
633ad2f,Alexander McGilvray,6 days ago,setup factory section for movement data parsing. Right now it just assigns dummy values. The movement data schema needs to be designed before moving onto parsing the data.
766096c,Alexander McGilvray,6 days ago,Added new character data movment constants section to character data
1b64813,Alexander McGilvray,6 days ago,Finished the refactoring of moving all the character states into their own file
d71a178,Alexander McGilvray,6 days ago,started moving character state implementations into their own files. First one is now done (ducking state)

4bc2ddd,Alexander McGilvray,6 days ago,refactored all remaning character states out into headers
9757348,Alexander McGilvray,6 days ago,Refactored out the idle state into it's own cpp file
6369f94,Alexander McGilvray,6 days ago,Created files to separate out the state logic from the factory class (it was just a temp place to get some logic up and going)
05db6e3,Alexander McGilvray,7 days ago,added a joystick mapping for the qanba evo ps3 fightstick
85e3e00,Alexander McGilvray,7 days ago,finished converting all current character data to have both a constant side and a mutable side
6a18e3b,Alexander McGilvray,7 days ago,completed work on converting character data constans for general data. Still need to do jump data
1d32f8f,Alexander McGilvray,7 days ago,splitting character data into a constants struct and a mutable data struct
2a0a1b1,Alexander McGilvray,8 days ago,Added debug draw output for joysticks so you can see what hardware buttons are being pressed
3e1d1e5,Alexander McGilvray,8 days ago,Fixed up the keyboard interface to have a previous frame state so we can determine when a button was just pressed or just released

e3eb43c,Alexander McGilvray,3 weeks ago,joystick button remapper interface
fd81a79,Alexander McGilvray,3 weeks ago,basic implementation for joystick controller
a7dfa59,Alexander McGilvray,3 weeks ago,ripped out the guts of the JoystickController interface because it was too bloated due to the fact it was originally an adaptation of the keyboard controller class. The joystick needs to be respected and given its own unique consideration in order to have a simpler interface and better management
7254ecb,Alexander McGilvray,3 weeks ago,sending current work to remote so I can review it later from a different computer 2
0fe9897,Alexander McGilvray,3 weeks ago,sending current work to remote so I can review it later from a different computer
5c2d1be,Alexander McGilvray,3 weeks ago,setup some rough code for getting joystick states. The algo is in the comments at the start of the function
64e42e6,Alexander McGilvray,3 weeks ago,added joystick button state and info structs
